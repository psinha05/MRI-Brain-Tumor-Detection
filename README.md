# MRI-Brain-Tumor-Detection : 
Brain tumors are classified as primary (originating in the brain) or secondary (metas-tasizing from elsewhere). Gliomas are the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumor in adults, accounting for 80%.According to the WHO, gliomas are classified into four grades: low grade (LGG) (grades 1-2), which are less prevalent and have low blood concentration and sluggish growth, and high grade (HGG) (grades 3-4), which have rapid growth and aggressiveness.

In This application we have using the BRATS-2020 dataset, Early diagnosis of brain tumor can help one avoiding the painful consequences as well as the life risk. Eventually, this diagnosis is the most crucial part since manual delineation of tumor form brain MRI is quite time consuminig and laborious also. A number of advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques that include Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), MR Spectroscopy (MRS) and Perfusion MR are used for the analysis of brain tumor through MRI.

Deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance for automatic brain tumor segmentation using multi-model MRIs. CNN is a highly effective method for picture ecognition and prediction. CNN is predominantly employed for brain tumor seg-mentation, classification, and survival time prediction. 

BRATS 2020 Dataset BRATS 2020 is a recently published benchmark dataset for the purpose of segment-ing the brain tumor.Indeed, a number of studies have already used this dataset for reporting and comparing their results. This 3D multimodal MRI dataset consists of 369 training cases, 125 validation cases 166 test cases. Among the training cases, 293 cases include the HGG tumor and 76 cases include the LGG tumor.
